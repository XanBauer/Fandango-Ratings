# Fandango-Ratings
A project investigating bias in Fandango's rating system

People's purchasing decisions can be greatly affected by the opinions of others. 
From a stranger's review on Amazon to a close friend recommending a restaurant, this feedback is invaluable to businesses.

Businesses have incentive to increase the positive ratings of their goods and services. In October 2015, Walt Hickey published [an article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) showing how Fandango, a business that sells movie tickets, was displaying inflated ratings of movies. 
After publishing this article, Fandango officals responded that the discrepancy was a result of a bug and would be fixed. 

This project uses movie rating data from multiple websites to answer the question: is there evidence to suggest that Fandango has stopped inflating the movie ratings displayed on their website?
